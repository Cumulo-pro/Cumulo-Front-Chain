This behavior did not exist prior to the upgrade. Investigation revealed that the local Ethereum node (geth + beacon) was under heavy load, causing unstable L1 feeds and triggering gateway throttling. Mitigation steps included: (1) temporarily stopping the local Ethereum node to confirm the bottleneck, which immediately improved block download speed; (2) switching Juno's --eth-node to a remote L1 endpoint hosted on another node of our infrastructure; (3) applying safe Juno performance tuning — increasing db-cache-size to 4096, db-max-handles to 4096, and widening gw-timeouts. After these changes, sync speed normalized, L1 feed stabilized, and catchUpMode loops ceased. All nodes now operate normally and no further impact has been detected."
