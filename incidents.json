Both key pairs (ISM signer + Kaspa escrow) were generated, extracted, and inserted with correct formatting, including the quoted Kaspa escrow secret and 0x-prefixed ISM validator key. Local Kaspa endpoints were configured through kaspaUrlsWrpc=127.0.0.1:17210 and kaspaUrlsRest=http://127.0.0.1:8000. A dummy kaspa.wallet was installed as required, validator DB initialized, environment variables exported, and systemd deployed to run the Hyperlane validator. In parallel, the Kaspa node stack (rusty-kaspad + utxoindex + rest + simply-kaspa-indexer) was fully deployed and verified, with REST API operational via /openapi.json and /info/health. The bridge validator and the complete Kaspa data stack are now fully active, synchronized, and functioning normally."

  "note": "Following the upgrade to Juno v0.15.11, both Starknet RPC and backup nodes began experiencing severe sync regression: block ingestion slowed dramatically, recurring 'Restarting sync process (catchUpMode)' events were logged, and L1 WebSocket subscriptions collapsed regularly with 'failed to read frame header: EOF'. This behavior did not exist prior to the upgrade. Investigation revealed that the local Ethereum node (geth + beacon) was under heavy load, causing unstable L1 feeds and triggering gateway throttling. Mitigation steps included: (1) temporarily stopping the local Ethereum node to confirm the bottleneck, which immediately improved block download speed; (2) switching Juno's --eth-node to a remote L1 endpoint hosted on another node of our infrastructure; (3) applying safe Juno performance tuning — increasing db-cache-size to 4096, db-max-handles to 4096, and widening gw-timeouts. After these changes, sync speed normalized, L1 feed stabilized, and catchUpMode loops ceased. All nodes now operate normally and no further impact has been detected."
